# android-habit-tracker-app

This project is part of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.
